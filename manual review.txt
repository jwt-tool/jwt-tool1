Firstly we need to register
 
We can leave message for admins, let’s text them smth
 
Okay, works as usual, but what if we will write a command instead of message?
 
As we can see this website is written in JS so let’s try to check for javascript injection
I have written such code 
<script>
alert(1);
</script>
 
Something new, so now we know that our JS script executed successfully so now we can try to do something to get our flag
Let’s try to write such script, that will make them send flag to us
So for that lets go to interacts, where we will see packages from a server and let’s write such script that will make this website enter to our server
 
So we got our domain here
Let’s put it inside script
 
This is my script and let’s submit it
And here is our flag
