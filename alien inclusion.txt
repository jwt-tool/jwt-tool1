This is what we got in our website 
We can see that if we will send a ‘start’ we will get something in ‘__file__’
And to do it we can use curl command in kali linux
Curl – is an utility that allows us transfer data to or from server remotely

curl '[link]/?start=' --data 'start=flag.php'

So here we send them data with start parameter, because we got written(photo), so we gave it to them and afterwards we ask to send us data that starts with flag.php
