Let’s check source code
 
So let’s modify our link with action string, so we will see what we will need to do afterwards
 
We got a hint that we need to use shell command
So let’s use this one: -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec="ls -la "
/dev/null /dev/null: These are special locations in the computer's memory where data can be discarded.
--checkpoint=1: This is a setting used by a specific program or script. It tells the program to create a checkpoint.
--checkpoint-action=exec="ls -la ": This is another setting for the program. It tells the program what action to take when it reaches a checkpoint. In this case, the action is to run a command called ls -la, which lists all files, even hidden files because of “a”.
 
Okay, it didn’t work for 100%
But still we found a new folder in which we might have our flag
So let’s check if we got our flag there with such command
-cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec="cat enhjenhzZGN3YWRzYWRhc2Rhc3NhY2FzY2FzY2FzY2FjYWNzZHNhY2FzY2Fzc2FjY2Fz/flag"
And here is our flag
