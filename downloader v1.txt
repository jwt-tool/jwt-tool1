Okay. We can make some input there
Let’s start with checking source code

Now we know that our flag is inside flag.php
Let’s try to input our own url and get flag from there

So to get our link I used such website as interacts and my link was generated there

Afterwards I added port and /php, because our flag is hidden in php and afterwards I gave such command as –post-file so website will send me their flag
